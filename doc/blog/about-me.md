# About Me

I am a software engineer at JPMorganChase & Co. working in Infrastracture Platforms, Databases Department. 

I specialize in:
* Python, Django
* Control planes, task orchestration
* Distributed systems engineering, system design
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ansible
* High scalability, resiliency, failover
* CockroachDB
* Databases, data caching
* React, Typescript

I am very involved in the Python/Django community. 

I became interested in Python and open-source code in 2013, and stumbled upon DjangoCon US through its website code hosted on GitHub. I became a DjangoCon US volunteer in 2016 and served as website chair or co-chair from 2017 to 2020. In 2017, I became a Django Events Foundation North America (DEFNA) Board Member. During my eight+ years as a board member, I served as corporate secretary from 2020 to 2022 and took great enjoyment in collaborating on the DjangoCon US website design every year. 

I frequently attend Python and Django conferences, make connections in person and online, and share what I've learned through conference recaps.

In my free time, I also enjoy watching documentaries, listening to music, traveling, eating good food.
