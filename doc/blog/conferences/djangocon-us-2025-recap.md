## Intro

Disclaimer: the content of this post is a reflection of my career journey and not specific to my work at JPMorganChase.

DjangoCon US took place in Chicago, Illinois from September 8-12. It was a stellar experience. 

Throughout the week, I couldn't help but think of the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off, widely considered to be a "love letter to Chicago" by director John Hughes and one of my favorite movies. After a day of adventures across Chicago, Cameron famously tells Ferris that [he doesn't think he has seen anything good](https://youtu.be/o0iVd8b5QyA?si=wxTvTEL98johebOB). 

I am happy to report that I saw everything good!

## Pre-conference Activities

### The View from Above

While making my flight reservation, I googled for advice about the best side of the plane to be on for a great view when arriving in Chicago. As we approached, I feared that I had chosen the wrong side, but I hadn't! The downtown appeared to my left, then the pilot circled around above Lake Michigan, and I got another view from the other side.

### The Field Museum

Thanks to my employer's generous financial support of Chicago area museums, I was able to enjoy some sightseeing perks, starting with the incredible [Field Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/). The museum owns over 30 million items that serve as a comprehensive record of life on Earth. Among these are unique and rare fossils, plants, insects, taxidermy animals, gems, meteorites, and cultural objects.

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/field-museum-patagotitan-maroyum.jpg)
Unearthed in Argentina, [M√°ximo Titanosaur](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/exhibition/maximo-titanosaur) (Patagotitan Mayorum), the largest animal to have ever walked the earth that we know of, lived 101.6 million years ago. He or she was estimated to have weighed 70 tons, spanned 122 feet long, and is 28 feet tall at the head. Say cheese! 

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/field-museum-the-lions-of-tsavo.jpg)
The infamous [Tsavo Lions](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/blog/tsavo-lions) are two of the most high profile items in the collection. In 1898, they went on a man-eating spree, terrorizing railway construction workers in Kenya for nine months, until they were shot dead. They were the subject of the 1996 movie The Ghost and the Darkness, starring Val Kilmer.

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/field-museum-megalodon-shark-replica-jaw.jpg)
[Megalodon](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/blog/four-fossil-sharks-are-cooler-megalodon), the largest shark to ever live, preyed on whales and went extinct when oceans worldwide got colder. This jaw and teeth (replica cast) was dated 23-3.6 million years ago. 

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/field-museum-inside-ancient-egypt.jpg)
Among the museum's holdings is one of the most impressive [ancient Egypt collections](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/exhibition/inside-ancient-egypt) in the world, including a three story replica of an ancient Egyptian tomb that contains two authentic burial chambers that date to 2400 B.C., 23 human and 30 animal mummies, artifacts from everyday life and mummification rituals.

### Shaw's Crab House Lunch Special

While researching Chicago, I came across many recommendations for Shaw's Crab House, a beloved, 40-year-old Chicago institution. I took a break from sightseeing to enjoy their reasonably-priced [gourmet 3-course lunch](https://www.shawscrabhouse.com/events/3-course-lunch-2/) special. The food was delicious, and the ambience left me feeling like I was a character in a movie.

### The Art Institute of Chicago

After lunch, I spent the afternoon at the [Art Institute of Chicago](https://www.artic.edu/). The Art Intitute is one of the world's great art museums, renowned for its collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art.  

Having looked through the museum's collection ahead of time and noted my favorites, I saw many great works. For fun, I also took the [Be Like Ferris Tour](https://www.artic.edu/my-museum-tour/5178), featuring art works seen in Ferris Bueller's Day Off when [Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane visit the museum](https://youtu.be/vBBOMLURSGA?si=3OLtiWJt2C2vB8jj).

### My Incredible Room

After sightseeing, I checked into my hotel. 

I was fortunate to stay at the 4-star [Thompson Chicago by Hyatt](https://www.hyatt.com/thompson-hotels/chith-thompson-chicago), perfectly situated in the fun [Gold Coast Neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_Historic_District_(Chicago)) along the Magnificent Mile, filled with historic architecture, luxury shops, and in close proximity to the Oak Street Beach.

### Pre-conference Social

On Sunday night, I decided to go to an informal pre-conference social at [Tiny Tapp](https://www.tinytapp.com/) organized by Jon Gould of [Foxley Talent](https://foxleytalent.com/). I made some new friends and was rewarded with this nighttime view of the buildings overlooking the Chicago River and [Riverwalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Riverwalk).

### Keynote: Lateral Thinking with Weathered Technology: How The Nintendo Philosophy Applies to Modern Web Development

[Lateral Thinking with Weathered Technology: How The Nintendo Philosophy Applies to Modern Web Development](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/keynote-monday/) by Carson Gross

Carson is the creator of the htmx library and the founder of the HyperMedia Research Group at Montana State University. 

htmx enables developers to use custom HTML attributes that trigger AJAX requests and update fragments of a page without a full reload, without using JavaScript. As a hypermedia-driven approach, the server can return HTML fragments.

Carson told the story of [Gunpei Yokoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpei_Yokoi), the original Game Boy designer. He was on a train in Japan and saw a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator. It inspired him to create a simple, handheld game with a two-bit screen (four total colors). 

Despite its mixed reviews and the sophistication of its competitor Sega with its full-color screen, Game Boy won massively. 

Why? Because techology is not its own end. It is in service to something else. You don't have to use the latest technology to have fun. 

Lateral thinking with weathered technology is about taking an existing technology and adapting it to a new use. This philosophy can be applied to web development. 

The industry prioritizes new things and pressures us to adopt them. The industry has left behind good ideas, such as hypermedia. 

HTML 2.0 transformed the web into a read-write hypermedia system, unlocking tremendous value. When Django was released in 2005, it was a hypermedia framework for producing HTML. In the 2010s a massive transformation happened- from hypermedia to JSON APIs feeding large JavaScript frontends. 

Hypermedia became the equivalent of the two-bit game boy. 

htmx provides a surprisingly modern web experiences using a hypermedia interface at a fraction of the complexity. 

Doing everything in JavaScript would rob Django of its Django-ness. Django's hypermedia-oriented features can become useful again

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/carson-gross-tips.jpg)
Tips from Carson

During Q&A, Jeff Triplett asked what can Django to do better support htmx/frameworks that embrace htmx (as of Django 6.0, template partials are baked-in) and Natalia Bidart pointed out the challenge with testing. 

As promised, soon thereafter Carson cut htmx release 2.0.7. Adam Johnson bundled it into his [django-htmx 1.24.1 release](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7372092845651873792/). 

Django community loves htmx. Adam Johnson and Carlton Gibson, former Django Fellow, are two high profile advocates. 

Useful-to-me notes:

* [django-htmx](https://github.com/adamchainz/django-htmx)

### Community Update: Django Events Foundation North America

DEFNA President Peter Grandstaff gave the update. 

What drives DEFNA Board Members? The people. 

People get involved, grow, expand, make the world better by helping others. Consider how you are reinvesting in the community. It's up to us. 

DjangoCon US 2026 needs:
* Organizers- anyone can help (email hello@defna.org)
* Sponsors- helps lower ticket prices, which have recently increased

DEFNA has put out a [Call for Venue Proposals](https://www.defna.org/announcements/2025/9/10/djangocon-us-call-for-venue-proposal-2027/) for DjangoCon US 2027-28. The deadline is January 15, 2026. If you have questions, feel free to talk to Peter Grandstaff or Keanya Phelps, both of whom have had their proposal accepted. 

Sprints are a way to contribute back to Django through code, docs, community. Lilian of Djangonaut Space talked about how to get started.

### Django for AI: Deploying Machine Learning Models with Django

[Django for AI: Deploying Machine Learning Models with Django](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/django-for-ai-deploying-machine-learning-models-with-django/) by Will Vincent

<!--
https://wsvincent.com/django-for-ai-djangocon/
-->

Will works as a developer advocate at JetBrains and is a popular author and contributor to the community.

His talk was about the shift happening due to AI. Django can and should be a part of it. 

According to the latest Django Developers survey, 70% of respondents use ChatGPT, a third use Copilot, Claude, JetBrains AI Assistant, and others. 

According to the most recent Python Developers Survey, FastAPI is used more than Django or Flask. 

Will says that at the Python conferences he has been to this year, attendees were discussing AI and FastAPI, not Django. 

Rather than burying our heads in the same, we need to learn from what is happening. 

Criticisms Will hears about Django... it is perceived as: 
* slow (FastAPI has "fast" in the name and is async by default)
* old (rather than boring and stable as some believe)
* big/hard to learn (akin to the Flask microframework versus batteries-included debate)

Will split his talk into two sections: 
* Classic Machine Learning protope- how to train a model from scratch and deploy to Django
* LLMs- the key difference between serving a classic machine learning model versus an LLM and a protype

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/jupyter-code.png)
Jupyter code... the start of the classic machine learning model in a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/wsvincent/iris_ml). 

Notably, this takes about 20 lines of code (including imports), with a mere 2 lines doing the training. A Jupyter cell can be added to enter inputs and see results for the model. The model is eventually saved as a joblib file, "a serialized Python object for saving and loading trained ML models." 

Django is the web interface we can use to bring the model to the world. 

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/django-gameplan.png)
Django gameplan

The code is in the repo [django_irisml](https://github.com/wsvincent/django_irisml). You can try it out at [DjangoforDataScience.com](https://djangofordatascience.com/). 

Will's books [Django for Beginners](https://www.amazon.com/Django-Beginners-5th-Modern-Applications/dp/173546726X) and [Django for Professionals](https://www.amazon.com/Django-Professionals-Production-websites-Python-ebook/dp/B08FNLQHGN?ref_=ast_author_dp&th=1&psc=1) explain many of the steps needed to create and deploy Django apps. 

Thank you to Will for a particularly relevant deep dive. It was my favorite talk of the conference.

### Django's GeneratedField by Example

[Django's GeneratedField by Example](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/django-s-generatedfield-by-example/) by Paolo Melchiorre

<!--
https://www.paulox.net/2025/09/08/djangocon-us-2025/
-->

Paolo walked through the process of how GeneratedField feature became a reality in [Django 5.0](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/releases/5.0/#database-generated-model-field). 

This was not his first time contributing to Django. In 2017, he added [RandomUUID for Postgres](https://github.com/django/django/commit/fcb5dbfec0542faaa1b0adad754a1caf1bcd65e2). 

The idea of a GeneratedField had existed for a while. A [now-stale ticket](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31300) had been made in 2020. 

In 2022, Paolo made a small code PoC and [proposed the idea in the Django Developers Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/9Mf7YqDA4bg/m/wb07E71oAAAJ). A lot of debate ensued. The feature was eventually implemented through PRs [#16417](https://github.com/django/django/pull/16417) and [#16860](https://github.com/django/django/pull/16860).

Paolo pointed to the Django performance and optimization docs which say that [it's almost always faster to work at a lower level](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/performance/#work-at-the-appropriate-level) (closer to the database). 

The GeneratedField can perform an operation on database fields at a database-level. It is supported by all db backends. 

Unfortunately, there was only one example in the docs. Paolo gave a plethora of examples.

## Tuesday

### Opening Remarks (Tuesday)

Peter Grandstaff gave the opening remarks. 

Questions: 
* Who has had fun in Chicago? 
* Who has learned something? 
* How many have been helped by someone we met at DjangoCon US?

Perhaps referencing Carson's talk, Peter identified Django as a weathered, seasoned tool that has withstood the test of time over 20 years. We are its guardian. 

Peter asked us to connect deeply and openly. 

It's not just about us, but about bringing lessons and successes, and growing good in a sometimes troubled world. 

Let's sustain Django and make the world a better place.

### Community Update: Python Software Foundation

Outgoing PSF Chair Dawn Wages gave the update. 

Three priorities:
* The deadline to vote in the 2025 Board Election was approaching. If you want to vote next year, become a member: spend 5 hours/month on average investing in the community or pay (sliding scale is available)
* [The PSF Grants program was temporarily paused](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/) after hitting the funding cap, which was a shock to the community
* The PSF will have a fundraiser soon

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/dawn-wages-psf-update.jpg)
Priorities 2 and 3

What qualifies for the 5 hours? Among other things: 
* Running a local meetup
* Contributing to open source
* Taking part in Djangonaut Space, Wagtail
* Being a DjangoCon US organizer
* Becoming a member of a [PSF Working Group](https://www.python.org/psf/workgroups/) or [DSF Working Group](https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups) (see Dawn's [blog post](https://dawnwages.info/bajoran-engineer/2023/06/07/python-software-foundation-working-groups-work-groups/), too)

Outside of voting, why care? Take a look at the [PSF Annual Impact Report](https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2024/). 

The Executive Director Deb Nicholson is the CEO of the PSF. The PSF Chair is the highest person who represents the community. Healthy friction is normal. The chair values consensus, finding a path forward. 

What lessons can the PSF take away from the DSF and vice versa?

Django is good at DEI, consistent community support, healthy conversations with the community about feature additions. 

Professionalism is a goal for the DSF, but difficult to reach. Python has been able to professionalize the organization, hire more people, take some burden off volunteers, but that also puts up a wall for volunteers to understand what is going on. 

How much can we afford and what are the responsibilities? OS leaders can help shepherd the DSF into the next chapters. 

PyCon US is the main source of funding for the PSF, but we are trying to move away from that. DEFNA manages DjangoCon US. 

How to get involved at a local level? Find a [PuG (Python User Group) on meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/pro/python-software-foundation-meetups/). Show up, ask questions, volunteer to pick up the pizza, get to know what the org does.

### Hidden Dangers Of AI In Developer Workflows: Navigating Security Risks with Human Insight

[Hidden Dangers Of AI In Developer Workflows: Navigating Security Risks with Human Insight](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/hidden-dangers-of-ai-in-developer-workflows-navigating-security-risks-with-human-insight/) by Dwayne McDaniel

<!--
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tzdzDd7Pmh-wdyfJhTgQyl6bFe-4JXpf5ISVpcIwVfc/edit
-->

Dwayne is a developer advocate at GitGuardian, an enterprise platform helping teams solve Non-Human Identity security crisis via secrets detection and remediation, developer tooling for prevention, honeytokens, and public monitoring of GitHub. 

A non-human identity is an agentic AI. 

Dwayne referenced the book God Emperor of Doom by Frank Herbert: "What do such machines really do? They increase the number of things we can do without thinking. Things we do without thinking‚Ä¶ there's the real danger."

This talk was about Generative AI that can introduce vulnerabilities into code, not Predictive AI. 

Specific dangers to developers:
1. The AI told me to do it that way
2. Hallucinations everywhere
3. You let the AI do what now? 

Dwayne referenced [the Nx "s1ngularity" Attack](https://blog.gitguardian.com/the-nx-s1ngularity-attack-inside-the-credential-leak/), "[likely one of the first documented cases of malware leveraging AI assistant CLIs for reconnaissance and data exfiltration.](https://snyk.io/blog/weaponizing-ai-coding-agents-for-malware-in-the-nx-malicious-package)" 

I learned about [OWASP Non-Human Identities Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-non-human-identities-top-10/) and [Gen AI Security Project](https://genai.owasp.org/) from Dwayne's talk, two of my favorite pieces of learning I took away from the conference.

### Django as a Database Documentation Tool: The Hidden Power of Model Comments

[Django as a Database Documentation Tool: The Hidden Power of Model Comments](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/django-as-a-database-documentation-tool-the-hidden-power-of-model-comments/) by Ryan Cheley

Ryan works in healthcare. Due to the complexity of the terminology, it can be difficult to decipher what data in a database table field is used for. 

There is a documentation gap. Code comments != database documentation. Wiki pages get stale. Undocumented expertise doesn't scale. 

Also, in his highly regulated field, regulatory auditors need field-level documentation. 

Database comments were introduced in [Django 4.2](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/releases/4.2/#comments-on-columns-and-tables). They are not supported in SQLite. 

Db comments can be at a field or table-level:
* Field-level: db_comment
* Table-level: db_table_comment

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/ryan-cheley-db-comment-example.jpg)
db_comment example

Not everyone has access to the frontend. 

help_text is only visible on the frontend/admin. It doesn't help on the database-side. 

It is recommended that help_text and db_comment both be used, but they tend to not be the same. 

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/ryan-cheley-different-audiences.jpg)
Different audiences, different needs
  
How to get started with database comments at a field-level
* Audit your top 10 most confusing fields (cryptic names, complex business logic)
* Document them (business context, calculation methodology, compliance notes)
* Standardize them (make it part of your code reviews, add tests that fail if db_comment is not there)

How to get started with database comments at a table-level
* Audit your top 10 most confusing tables
* Identify the table owner
* Document, standardize, test

This can make life easier for those who only have access to the database and our future selves.

## Wednesday

### Pre-conference

I knew Wednesday morning would likely be my last chance to make the short walk from my hotel to Oak Street Beach. I couldn't resist getting up early to do so. It was surprisingly beach-like, despite bordering Lake Michigan. I enjoyed a quiet walk down the coast and watched nearby beach-goers play vollyball and cold-plunge.

### Keynote: Django Reimagined For The Age of AI

[Django Reimagined For The Age of AI](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/keynote-wednesday/) by Marlene Mhangami

Marlene led the first PyCon Africa and is a former PSF Chair. She is an explorer and maker, and one of my favorite follows on social media. 

Marlene pointed out that ChatGPT was the fastest growing app in history and the 5th most visited website in the world. AI is not just for CEOs are futurists. Real people are using it in their everyday lives. We should pay attention. 

What does the future of Django look like in the age of AI?

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/marlene-mhangami-key-points.jpg)

Despite the [Django design philosophy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/misc/design-philosophies/#explicit-is-better-than-implicit) (based on [The Zen of Python/PEP 20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)) that Django should not do too much magic, LLMs feel like magic. 

To better understand what an LLLM is, Marlene demonstrated an [LLM token probability visualizer](https://marlenezw.github.io/token-probability/) that she had made ([code](https://github.com/marlenezw/token-probability)). 

Context matters. 

Can we trust LLMs? Marlene gave the example of Grok telling people about "White Genocide." 

She said AI presents serous ethical issues, and we need to hold frontier labs accountable and expect transparency for what LLMs say to the public and environmental issues. 

Just because something is flawed, it does not mean it isn't useful. 

As a Django dev, how can I control the context I send? 
1. Rag
2. MCP
3. Agents.md

RAG involves feeding info from docs or a database into an LLM through the messages param in order control how the LLM responds. 


![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/marlene-mhangami-mcp.jpg)

While vibe coding in VSCode, you can use an [agents.md file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions#_use-an-agentsmd-file-experimental) to specify best practices to follow. 

AI generated code falls short in security, scalability, and maintainability. 

How do we prevent leaving people behind? 

Marlene told about the non-profit ZimboPy that she started with Ron Maravanyika to teach girls in Zimbabwe to code. Marlene was moved by the support received from the Django community, even though she was not a member. This is something unique about the Django community. 

They utilized the popular and effective Django Girls tutorial that helps women "fall in love" with programming. 

Although the initative started in affluent areas, they went to rural areas, too. The conditions were tough. There was no internet in community centers and electricity only some of the time. 

She has been [exploring the use of a small language model bot offline](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marlenemhangami_i-spent-a-bunch-of-time-recently-experimenting-activity-7373746042548355072-9DI6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAOxk18BcgN6WcUZfIqPuO1XxHylxwxaOJ4) to walk learners through the Django Girls tutorial in places like this. 

She says people still need to learn programming from scratch, but can be inspired by vibe coding. Be modular. Do a section at a time, read through the code yourself. Test the code. 

Action items for making Django more friendly to work with LLMs:
* Central resources
* Tell a Django AI story
* Be open to AI as a community and framework
* Make it clear and straightforward to integrate an LLM with a Django app to create a chat app (think FastAPI)

Chat is the primary interface and Marlene believes it will continue to be. 

Resources from Marlene's talk can be found in her [GitHub repo](https://github.com/marlenezw/djangocon-25-keynote).

### Community Update: Django Software Foundation

DSF President Thibaud Colas, DSF Treasurer Jacob Kaplan-Moss, DSF Board Member Paolo Melchiorre, and Django 6.x Steering Council Member Frank Wiles gave the update. 

News
* New Django Fellow Jacob Walls
* New DSF Working Groups: social media, events
* Proposed DSF Working Groups: DEI, AI
* DSF Board elections are coming up later this fall

[Django 6.0](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/6.0/) freeze and sprints- what will land:
* [django-csp](https://django-csp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) into core
* Template partials (important to htmx fans)
* Async tasks framework

Based on an idea Paolo documented in his blog post [My Django active developers Sprints proposal](https://www.paulox.net/2022/10/26/my-django-active-developers-sprints-proposal/), Carlton Gibson and Paolo have begun to organize a twice a year Django development sprint called Django on the Med in Palafrugell, Spain and Pescara, Italy. The first one will taken place October 7-9, 2025, in Palafrugell Spain. If all goes well, they hope to organize them around the world. See the [Django on the Med](https://djangomed.eu/) website for info about their serious goals and how to attend. 

On the subject of convincing your employer to let you attend, Paolo suggested sharing ≈Åukasz Langa's recent blog post [Sprints are the best part of a conference](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/09/sprints-are-best-part-of-conference.html). "You're getting for free what you wouldn't be able to buy if you tried."

![](djangocon-us-2025-recap-images/paolo-melchiorre-dsf-update-django-on-the-med.jpg)
Django on the Med

Jacob Kaplan-Moss gave a budget update, referencing his [DjangoCon US 2024 talk](https://2024.djangocon.us/talks/if-we-had-1000000-what-could-the-dsf-do-with-4x-its-budget/). Typically, the DSF has an $18,000 surplus. This year will be a loss. The DSF has decided to make some bets. For example, the fellow role has become increasingly unsustainable. The DSF will need the help of the community to make these bets permanent. Consider supporting the DSF. 

If you have helped the Django community in some way, you may be eligible to become a DSF Individual Member. You can be nominated or self-nominate.

### What a Decade!

[What a Decade!](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/what-a-decade/) by Tim Allen

Tim told the audience, you are my people, people trying to be a better version of themselves everyday and make the world a better place. 

Tim is a Principal Engineer at Wharton Research Data Services who loves ice cream. 

Once upon a time, Wharton was a Coldfusion and Microsoft SQL Server Shop. In 2013, technical debt was mounting. Wharton needed to find something new. 

Wharton created the Development Technology Assessment Process (DevTAP), a series of 200 questions to score that would be used to identify a new technology. The process was designed to be iterative so that decisions could be revisited and re-assessed. 

Wharton chose Python/Django as the new framework, but the only community question had been: How active is the tool on Stack Overflow? 

They got lucky that the community was morally and ethically aligned with them. 

This community walks the walk when it comes to DEI.

Tim was blown away that Russell Keith-Magee opened up to the community about his [personal battles with depression](https://pyvideo.org/djangocon-us-2015/i-am-a-doctor-tw-by-russell-keith-magee.html). If someone as accomplished as Russell could be vulnerable, so can we. We all have a deep-rooted fear that we won't be accepted. 

Tim shared his personal journey with alcoholism. 

Tim had brought Han Dynasty food to PyCon 2015 in Montreal as a bribe to host DjangoCon US in Philly (fun fact: the day before PyGotham 2018, I randomly saw Tim in mid-town Manhattan and joined his group for dinner at Han Dynasty). 

Tim's alcoholism was progressing. He had intended to go a full month without drinking, but never had. 

Frank Wiles bought him his last drink ever. 

Jacob Kaplan-Moss gave a [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE) in which he quoted Lynn Root that we'd know when diversity efforts have been successful when we see a whole bunch of average women programmers. The talk has become a part of an amazing confluence of events that changed Tim's life forever. 

He had no idea it was his first day sober. Returning home, he found his family there to stage an intervention. He accepted the help that was being offered. 

He had to be open that he was being intentional to no longer drink. Tim was assured that recovery is part of DjangoCon US diversity initatives and welcome. Steps were taken to de-emphasize alcohol, and local recovery groups were added to the conference website. 

Tim was going to focus on tech in his talk, but that changed on Friday when he found out his co-worker Lindsay Rees has passed away. 

He does not believe he would be alive if not for the support he has gotten. 

The community is willing to have difficult conversations and help. "You matter. You are valued."

## Post-Conference

### Wendella Chicago Architecture Boat Tour

I'd heard many great things about Chicago architecture boat cruises and considered taking one on Sunday, but decided it would be one thing too many. When I heard that a group of attendees would be taking one Wednesday evening, I had to join. It surpassed my expections, and I'd love to go again sometime.

### Giordano's

After the boat trip, several of us stopped to eat at Navy Pier Giordano's. 

Earlier in the week, I'd had a [Lou Malnati's](https://www.loumalnatis.com/) deep-dish, Chicago Classic with sausage, mozzarella, and tomato sauce on a Buttercrust‚Ñ¢. The pizza was tasty, but it was surprisingly watery, and the crust was difficult to cut. [Giordano's](https://giordanos.com/) pizza sauce was a bit too sweet for me. I am Goldilocks. Maybe next visit, I will find my perfect deep-dish pizza. 

I had delicious fettuccini alfredo instead.
