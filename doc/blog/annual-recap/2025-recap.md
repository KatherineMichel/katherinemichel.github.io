JPMorganChase Plano celebrated Texas Independence Day with line dancing, painting classes, Texas trivia, and a photo op with a real Texas longhorn.

### Spring Fun for My Nieces

Last year, I set the goal to do random, fun things for my nieces. I continued this year. 

I ordered a special delivery of board games and fun toys including Checkers, Chinese checkers, Twister, Trouble, Pictionary, Scrabble, Exploding Kittens, and Do you Really Know Your Family?. The Magic 8 Ball in particular was a big hit. 

🔝 <sub>[**back to top**](#table-of-contents)</sub>

### Jamie Dimon Plano Townhall

Jamie Dimon visited Plano a few weeks before I joined JPMorganChase. I was disappointed to have missed it. 

When I found out he was visiting again to do a townhall, I had to attend. 

I saw the Queen of England in-person a few times. Jamie Dimon might be the second-most influential person I've ever seen. He was exactly the same as he is on TV. 

I arrived at 11:30 am and had 40 people waiting in line in front of me. I got a great seat!

## April

### Trip to Belton, Missouri

Mom and I traveled to Belton, Missouri to attend my niece's last gymnastics meet of the season. I only found out after the trip that we were near the Mahomes Family home! 

🔝 <sub>[**back to top**](#table-of-contents)</sub>

#### La Nonna

The evening before the meet, I googled "Best restaurant in Belton." The answer was [La Nonna](https://www.orderlanonnabelton.com/).

Mom wasn't too sure about the place, until the bread came out. It was heavenly.

#### Last Gymnastics Meet of the Season

I've never been to a gymnastics tournament before. It was surreal to find out that famous gymnasts start out at tournaments just this and rise to the top of the sport. 

My niece did well, and I interviewed her afterward for fun. She said, if I ever want to interview her again, she is happy to do it!

### Investment

### Lucy's Bakery

JPMorganChase Plano invites local vendors to sell food at lunchtime. [Lucy's Bakery](https://www.lucisbakery.com/) is my favorite. They serve Argentinian empanadas and arepas (round, flat corn patty sliced open and filled with protein). Chicken is my go-to.

### Fun in Dallas

It was great hosting colleagues from London in Plano and a perfect opportunity to extend some Texas-style hospitality. I love that my work is a passport to the world.

🔝 <sub>[**back to top**](#table-of-contents)</sub>

#### Hutchins BBQ

[Hutchins BBQ](https://hutchinsbbq.com/) is a must-visit when you are in Dallas.

#### Battle House Laser Tag

I played laser tag for the first time at a team-building event at [Battle House](https://www.battlehouselasercombat.com/plano-tx/). My co-workers keep me young.

[Scheels in The Colony](https://www.scheels.com/store/the-colony/096/) contains a 65-foot indoor Ferris wheel. It costs $1 to ride. I jumped at the chance.

## May

### Vonda Wright's Building Better Bone

One of my managers from work randomly texted me to suggest that I watch [an interview](https://youtu.be/ffgpqk5hZBE?si=tJRCGOYYjrReQhAm) with an "amazing" doctor named Vonda Wright. He had no idea we are from the same town and that she was my childhood ballet teacher. Vonda is now a highly regarded orthopedic sports surgeon who trains high performance athletes and teaches women midlife and beyond how to reach "max badassery." 

![](2025-recap-images/me-and-vonda.jpeg)
Me and my incredible ballet teacher Vonda Wright in her studio at the back of her dad's shop in our hometown.

As I get older, I have started to learn how underserved by the healthcare industry women midlife and beyond are. Dr. Vonda is trying to change that by starting the conversation and providing the most up-to-date, science-based knowledge and tools available. 

Dr. Vonda has the bones of a 30-year-old. Bone health is an important topic that many of us do not know enough about until it's too late.

![](2025-recap-images/vonda-wright-building-better-bone.jpg)
I signed up for the [Building Better Bone](https://www.drvondawright.net/betterbone) course.

### Zero Latency Virtual Reality

I experienced VR for the first time at [Zero Latency Virtual Reality](https://zerolatencyvr.com/en/frisco). It was amazing! So realistic.

### Stepped Down From DEFNA Board

After ~8 years on the DEFNA Board, I stepped down. This [thank you from the board](https://www.defna.org/defna-board-member-update-july) was a wonderful surprise!

### Eating Clean

After I was diagnosed with high cholesterol last year, I began to adjust my eating habits in line with the recommendations of my doctor. After some health issues this year, including both a stomach bug and food poisoning, I wanted to start "eating clean" for good. I have replaced many high cholesterol foods with low-cholesterol alternatives. While I have not completely cut out red/poultry meat and dairy, by default, I do not eat it at home, and I eat it less often outside of home. On the occassion that I eat it, it is less impactful.  

When I did my annual physical later in the year, I had lost 16 pounds, my cholesterol was greatly reduced, and I did not need a prescription, to my great surprise. 

Some favorite substitutions: 
* Hummus and triscuits instead of dairy-based dip and potato chips
* Grapes, strawberries, or blueberries instead of an egg, bacon, and croissant breakfast sandwich or afternoon snack containing refined sugar
* A low cholesterol salad as a quick, healthy meal or snack
* A salmon filet drizzled with olive oil, lemon juice, and a bit of honey, baked and served with steamed veggies or rice instead of a hamburger or dairy-based dinner
* Almond milk or skim/low-fat milk instead of whole milk (almond milk is not a doctor's recommendation, just a personal preference at times)

### Stroopwafels

It's not everyday that you get a special delivery of stroopwafels from the Netherlands! Thank you to Roy Tomeij and AppSignal for your generosity. It put a huge smile on my face! I also love the Developer Dilemmas card deck.

I always enjoy seeing mom have fun at work. When the rodeo comes to town, the celebrities stop by the nursing home where she works to meet the residents.

## September

### Vonda Wright's Unbreakable

After I read an interview Vonda Wright did for The Times, I immediately bought her new book [Unbreakable](https://www.drvondawright.com/resources/books/unbreakable). I know she is a voice you can trust. 

Her words on page 23 of the Kindle version hit me: "Movement gives you agency over life." That is what it's about: agency over life. 

I immediately felt motivated to take action. I also love that she uses her dad Gene as an example in the book.

Along with the Building Better Bone course, it is a lifestyle change that I am in the process of implementing and will take time.

Phil was part of the interview process when I was hired at JPMorganChase and Christine and Julie were two of my teammates. I have learned so much from all of them!

### Six Flags

<!--
https://www.sixflags.com/overtexas/attractions/new-texas-giant
-->

JPMorganChase Plano offered discounted Six Flags tickets. I couldn't resist buying one. It had been years since I'd been to an amusement park. 

I decided to go on the two most popular rollercoasters first and get that out of the way. So I trekked to the far corner of the park where The Texas Giant and Titan are. I encountered The Texas Giant first, so I went on it. Oh my. It was intense and relentless. I felt nauseous by the time I got off. I sat for a while outside of the Titan entryway, wondering if I could go on it, but I could see that it was similarly extreme. I decided to walk away. 

As I was walking, I started to feel terrible. I walked straight into a bathroom, went into a stall, and threw up. 

The heat didn't help. I guess my amusement park days are over.

#### Tour Around Town

Mom and I went on a little Fredonia driving tour. I couldn’t resist a photo at my high school in front of a yellowjacket sculpture made by a student. Fredonia High School is on the site of the former Ben S. Paulen Elementary School. I started school at and graduated from the same place.

Our Airbnb was conveniently located directly across the street from Tri-Mee, a Fredonia institution. We walked acoss for a jumbo beef burger, Frito Pie, fries, and chocolate milk shake. I hadn't had a beef burger in years and had two of them within 24 hours in Fredonia. The town has a beef burger thing.
