<h2>Intro<a class="headerlink" href="#intro" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>DjangoCon US took place in Chicago, Illinois from September 8-12. It was a stellar experience.</p>
<p>Ensuring Django is relevant for the next 20 years and Django and the AI landscape were hot topics, in addition to the latest Django features and community news.</p>
<p>I was also able to spend the day before the conference sightseeing. I couldn‚Äôt help but think of the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller‚Äôs Day Off, widely considered to be a ‚Äúlove letter to Chicago‚Äù by director John Hughes and one of my favorite movies. After a day of adventures across Chicago, Cameron famously tells Ferris that <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/o0iVd8b5QyA?si=wxTvTEL98johebOB">he doesn‚Äôt think he has seen anything good</a>.</p>
<p>I am happy to report that I saw everything good!</p>

<p>While making my flight reservation, I googled for advice about the best side of the plane to be on for a great view when arriving in Chicago. As we approached, I feared that I had chosen the wrong side, but I hadn‚Äôt! The downtown appeared to my left, then the pilot circled around above Lake Michigan, and I got another view from the other side.</p>

<h3>The Field Museum<a class="headerlink" href="#the-field-museum" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Thanks to my employer‚Äôs generous financial support of Chicago area museums, I was able to enjoy some sightseeing perks, starting with the incredible <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/">Field Museum</a>. The museum owns over 30 million items that serve as a comprehensive record of life on Earth. Among these are unique and rare fossils, plants, insects, taxidermy animals, gems, meteorites, and cultural objects.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/field-museum-patagotitan-maroyum.jpg" />
Unearthed in Argentina, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/exhibition/maximo-titanosaur">M√°ximo Titanosaur</a> (Patagotitan Mayorum), the largest animal to have ever walked the earth that we know of, lived 101.6 million years ago. He or she was estimated to have weighed 70 tons, spanned 122 feet long, and is 28 feet tall at the head. Say cheese!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/field-museum-the-lions-of-tsavo.jpg" />
The infamous <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/blog/tsavo-lions">Tsavo Lions</a> are two of the most high profile items in the collection. In 1898, they went on a man-eating spree, terrorizing railway construction workers in Kenya for nine months, until they were shot dead. They were the subject of the 1996 movie The Ghost and the Darkness, starring Val Kilmer.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/field-museum-megalodon-shark-replica-jaw.jpg" />
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/blog/four-fossil-sharks-are-cooler-megalodon">Megalodon</a>, the largest shark to ever live, preyed on whales and went extinct when oceans worldwide got colder. This jaw and teeth (replica cast) was dated 23-3.6 million years ago.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/field-museum-inside-ancient-egypt.jpg" />
Among the museum‚Äôs holdings is one of the most impressive <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/exhibition/inside-ancient-egypt">ancient Egypt collections</a> in the world, including a three story replica of an ancient Egyptian tomb that contains two authentic burial chambers that date to 2400 B.C., 23 human and 30 animal mummies, artifacts from everyday life and mummification rituals.</p>

<p>After lunch, I spent the afternoon at the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.artic.edu/">Art Institute of Chicago</a>. The Art Institute is one of the world‚Äôs great art museums, renowned for its collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art.</p>

<h3>Keynote: Lateral Thinking with Weathered Technology: How the Nintendo Philosophy Applies to Modern Web Development<a class="headerlink" href="#keynote-lateral-thinking-with-weathered-technology-how-the-nintendo-philosophy-applies-to-modern-web-development" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>

[Lateral Thinking with Weathered Technology: How the Nintendo Philosophy Applies to Modern Web Development](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/keynote-monday/) by Carson Gross
-->
<p>Carson Gross is the creator of the htmx library and the founder of the HyperMedia Research Group at Montana State University.</p>
<p>htmx enables developers to use custom HTML attributes that trigger AJAX requests and update fragments of a page without a full reload, without using JavaScript. As a hypermedia-driven approach, the server can return HTML fragments.</p>
<p>Carson told the story of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpei_Yokoi">Gunpei Yokoi</a>, the original Game Boy designer. He was on a train in Japan and saw a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator. It inspired him to create a simple, handheld game with a two-bit screen (four total colors).</p>
<p>Despite its mixed reviews and the sophistication of its competitor Sega with its full-color screen, Game Boy won massively.</p>
<p>Why? Because technology is not its own end. It is in service to something else. You don‚Äôt have to use the latest technology to have fun.</p>
<p>Lateral thinking with weathered technology is about taking an existing technology and adapting it to a new use. This philosophy can be applied to web development.</p>
<p>The industry prioritizes new things and pressures us to adopt them. The industry has left behind good ideas, such as hypermedia.</p>
<p>HTML 2.0 transformed the web into a read-write hypermedia system, unlocking tremendous value. When Django was released in 2005, it was a hypermedia framework for producing HTML. In the 2010s a massive transformation happened- from hypermedia to JSON APIs feeding large JavaScript frontends.</p>
<p>Hypermedia became the equivalent of the two-bit game boy.</p>
<p>htmx provides a surprisingly modern web experiences using a hypermedia interface at a fraction of the complexity.</p>
<p>Doing everything in JavaScript would rob Django of its Django-ness. Django‚Äôs hypermedia-oriented features can become useful again</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-carson-gross-tips.jpg" />
Tips from Carson</p>
<p>During Q&amp;A, Jeff Triplett asked what can Django to do better support htmx/frameworks that embrace htmx (as of Django 6.0, template partials are baked-in) and Natalia Bidart pointed out the challenge with testing.</p>
<p>As promised, Carson cut htmx release 2.0.7 the same day. Adam Johnson bundled it into his <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7372092845651873792/">django-htmx 1.24.1 release</a>.</p>
<p>Django community loves htmx. Adam Johnson and Carlton Gibson, former Django Fellow, are two high profile advocates.</p>

<h3>Django for AI: Deploying Machine Learning Models with Django<a class="headerlink" href="#django-for-ai-deploying-machine-learning-models-with-django" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<!--
[Django for AI: Deploying Machine Learning Models with Django](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/django-for-ai-deploying-machine-learning-models-with-django/) by Will Vincent
-->
<p>Will Vincent works as a developer advocate at JetBrains and is a popular author, Django Chat podcaster, and Django News newsletter curator.</p>
<p>His talk was about the shift happening due to AI. Django can and should be a part of it.</p>
<p>According to the latest Django Developers survey, 70% of respondents use ChatGPT, a third use Copilot, Claude, JetBrains AI Assistant, and others.</p>
<p>According to the most recent Python Developers Survey, FastAPI is used more than Django or Flask.</p>
<p>Will says that at the Python conferences he has been to this year, attendees were discussing AI and FastAPI, not Django.</p>
<p>Rather than burying our heads in the same, we need to learn from what is happening.</p>
<p>Criticisms Will hears about Django‚Ä¶ it is perceived as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>slow (FastAPI has ‚Äúfast‚Äù in the name and is async by default)</p></li>
<li><p>old (rather than boring and stable as some believe)</p></li>
<li><p>big/hard to learn (akin to the Flask microframework versus batteries-included debate)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Will split his talk into two sections:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Classic Machine Learning prototype- how to train a model from scratch and deploy to Django</p></li>
<li><p>LLMs- the key difference between serving a classic machine learning model versus an LLM, followed by a protype</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-will-vincent-jupyter-code.png" />
Jupyter code‚Ä¶ the start of the classic machine learning model in a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wsvincent/iris_ml">Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, Will‚Äôs classic machine learning model consists of about 20 lines of code (including imports), with a mere 2 lines doing the training. A Jupyter cell can be added to enter inputs and see results for the model. The model is eventually saved as a joblib file, ‚Äúa serialized Python object for saving and loading trained ML models.‚Äù</p>
<p>Django is the web interface we can use to bring the model to the world.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-will-vincent-gameplan.png" />
Django gameplan</p>
<p>The iris.joblib file is added to the base directory.</p>
<p>A function-based view accepts forms values from the user and makes predictions using the model.</p>
<p>Optional:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A models directory for multiple models</p></li>
<li><p>A model to store predictions- the data can used to retrain the model</p></li>
<li><p>A Django admin to see user responses and predictions in real time and interact with the data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The code is in the repo <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wsvincent/django_irisml">django_irisml</a>. You can try it out at <a class="reference external" href="https://djangofordatascience.com/">DjangoforDataScience.com</a>.</p>
<p>Will‚Äôs books <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Django-Beginners-5th-Modern-Applications/dp/173546726X">Django for Beginners</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Django-Professionals-Production-websites-Python-ebook/dp/B08FNLQHGN?ref_=ast_author_dp&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1">Django for Professionals</a> explain many of the steps needed to create and deploy Django apps.</p>
<p>Will‚Äôs key point is that the model created in this not so big as to be computationally hard to serve. Django is great for small and medium ML models.</p>
<p>Will moved on to LLMs.</p>
<p>They are token prediction machines.</p>
<p>Will explained the AI hierarchy of Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning. LLMs are a form of Deep Learning.</p>
<p>These concepts have been around since the 1940s, but there were technical challenges around scaling them.</p>
<p>Original architectures were sequential, one token at a time. Google‚Äôs famous 2017 paper ‚Äú<a class="reference external" href="https://research.google/pubs/attention-is-all-you-need/">All You Need is Attention</a>‚Äù demonstrated that you could look at all the tokens at once.</p>
<p>OpenAI‚Äôs 2020 paper <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361">Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models Paper</a> showed the bigger your LLM model, dataset, and compute, the better the result.</p>
<p>These two concepts together were revolutionary.</p>
<p>The two stages to building an LLM model:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Training: vacuum up the entire internet</p></li>
<li><p>Inference: inputs are fed into an LLM model, computed, output streamed. Text works best.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Key training tasks</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Data prep: data has to be cleaned, deduplicated, offensive content removed</p></li>
<li><p>Getting data: some sources are weighted more highly than others.</p></li>
<li><p>Tokenization: transforming words (or subwords) into numerical IDs. Will says there are approximately one quadrillion tokens.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Will gave a detailed explanation of how LLM inference works.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-will-vincent-llm-inference-processing.png" />
LLM inference processing</p>
<p>Will‚Äôs point ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the web itself has never been more important. These fancy models are useless without a way to connect them to paying users. How do they do that? With the web. But there‚Äôs a catch. Serving these models via inference is radically different than the database-driven paradigm we‚Äôre all used to with Django.‚Äù</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-will-vincent-traditional-web-request-versus-inference.png" />
Traditional web request versus inference</p>
<p>Why Django is a poor choice to serve LLM models:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Frontier-level models are terabytes size</p></li>
<li><p>We cannot optimize inference like a traditional web request served up by a database. We can only buy more GPU. Every input causes a GPU cluster to run, which is expensive.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-will-vincent-llm-inference-api-fastapi.png" />
FastAPI is built into many AI tools. Uses Starlette ASGI framework, Pydantic, can stream token asynchronously.</p>
<p>Will said, Django can do more than you think.</p>
<p>In line with Carson‚Äôs talk, Will used ‚Äúthe boring old web‚Äù to create a Django LLM chatbot prototype:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Server-sent events: send one HTTP request, receive a streaming response (StreamingHttpResponse- added in Django 1.5 in 2013)</p></li>
<li><p>HTML Streaming</p></li>
<li><p>Two templates and htmx- no JavaScript</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> model <a class="reference external" href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/">Gemma</a> 3:4B streams tokens to an API endpoint</p></li>
<li><p>Python generator sends one token at a time</p></li>
<li><p>Regular synchronous views</p></li>
<li><p>Results stored in database and accessed via admin</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wsvincent/djangoforai">code</a></p>
<p>Thank you to Will for a particularly relevant deep dive. It was my favorite talk of the conference. Inspired by Simon Willison, Will did a <a class="reference external" href="https://wsvincent.com/django-for-ai-djangocon/">detailed write-up</a> of this talk.</p>

[Django's GeneratedField by Example](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/django-s-generatedfield-by-example/) by Paolo Melchiorre
-->
<p>Paolo Melchiorre walked through the process of how GeneratedField feature became a reality in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/releases/5.0/#database-generated-model-field">Django 5.0</a>.</p>
<p>This was not his first time contributing to Django. In 2017, he added <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/fcb5dbfec0542faaa1b0adad754a1caf1bcd65e2">RandomUUID for Postgres</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of a GeneratedField had existed for a while. A <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31300">now-stale ticket</a> had been made in 2020.</p>
<p>In 2022, Paolo made a small code PoC and <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/9Mf7YqDA4bg/m/wb07E71oAAAJ">proposed the idea in the Django Developers Forum</a>. A lot of debate ensued. The feature was eventually implemented through PRs <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/16417">#16417</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/16860">#16860</a>.</p>
<p>Paolo pointed to the Django performance and optimization docs which say that <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/performance/#work-at-the-appropriate-level">it‚Äôs almost always faster to work at a lower level</a> (closer to the database).</p>
<p>The GeneratedField can perform an operation on database fields at a database-level. It is supported by all db backends.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was only one example in the docs. Paolo gave a plethora of examples including geometric, DateRange, JSONObject, full-text search, and GIS calculations.</p>

<!--
[All the Ways to Use Django](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/keynote-tuesday/) by Zags (Benjamin Zagorsky)
-->
<p>Zags (Benjamin Zagorsky) is the co-founder and CTO of Zagaran, Inc. a software consultancy. He has used Django extensively and has seen a lot of use cases, including unexpected ones.</p>
<p>He gave a wealth of info from his experiences.</p>
<p>Some scenarios covered in his talk:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Django and frontend frameworks</p></li>
<li><p>Django and multi-service architectures</p></li>
<li><p>Django and other databases- Django‚Äôs ORM is pluggable</p></li>
<li><p>Django and worker environments</p></li>
<li><p>Inheriting an ecosystem- the Stranger Fig Pattern, transitioning a Python service to Django, using Django patterns outside of Django</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Django‚Äôs greatest strength: boilerplate reduction. Django provides the generic code. You can write the code specific to your app.</p>
<p>Django‚Äôs most powerful feature: the ORM</p>
<p>Zags warned that looking at StackOverflow tags data, Django appears to be losing popularity to Next.js. This could be because Django is well-documented and stable.</p>
<p>Zags said, maybe Django needs a JavaScript Strategy. To make it another 20 years, we need to accept that JavaScript is part of the web.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-benjamin-zagorsky-javascript-easy.jpg" />
Easy ideas: Django 1.7 absorbed South and it bacame Django migrations. Could the same happen with Django Rest Framework?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-benjamin-zagorsky-javascript-medium.jpg" />
Medium hard ideas</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-benjamin-zagorsky-javascript-three-more-ideas.jpg" />
Three more ideas: Next.js has an entire hosting menu even though they sell hosting and is a recommended framework for partnership with React</p>
<p>Final thoughts: help Django get there, but don‚Äôt wait for Django to get there.</p>

<h3>Community Update: Python Software Foundation<a class="headerlink" href="#community-update-python-software-foundation" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Outgoing PSF Chair Dawn Wages gave the update.</p>
<p>Three priorities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The deadline to vote in the 2025 Board Election was approaching. If you want to vote next year, become a member: spend 5 hours/month on average investing in the community or pay (sliding scale is available)</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/">The PSF Grants program was temporarily paused</a> after hitting the funding cap, which was a shock to the community</p></li>
<li><p>The PSF will have a fundraiser soon</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-dawn-wages-psf-update.jpg" />
Priorities 2 and 3</p>
<p>What qualifies for the 5 hours? Among other things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Running a local meetup</p></li>
<li><p>Contributing to open source</p></li>
<li><p>Taking part in Djangonaut Space, Wagtail</p></li>
<li><p>Being a DjangoCon US organizer</p></li>
<li><p>Becoming a member of a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf/workgroups/">PSF Working Group</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups">DSF Working Group</a> (see Dawn‚Äôs <a class="reference external" href="https://dawnwages.info/bajoran-engineer/2023/06/07/python-software-foundation-working-groups-work-groups/">blog post</a>, too)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of voting, why care? Take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2024/">PSF Annual Impact Report</a>.</p>
<p>The Executive Director Deb Nicholson is the CEO of the PSF. The PSF Chair is the highest person who represents the community. Healthy friction is normal. The chair values consensus, finding a path forward.</p>
<p>What lessons can the PSF take away from the DSF and vice versa?</p>
<p>Django is good at DEI, consistent community support, healthy conversations with the community about feature additions.</p>
<p>Professionalism is a goal for the DSF, but difficult to reach. Python has been able to professionalize the organization, hire more people, take some burden off volunteers, but that also puts up a wall for volunteers to understand what is going on.</p>
<p>How much can we afford and what are the responsibilities? OS leaders can help shepherd the DSF into the next chapters.</p>
<p>PyCon US is the main source of funding for the PSF, but we are trying to move away from that. DEFNA manages DjangoCon US.</p>
<p>How to get involved at a local level? Find a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/python-software-foundation-meetups/">PuG (Python User Group) on meetup.com</a>. Show up, ask questions, volunteer to pick up the pizza, get to know what the org does.</p>

<!--
[Django as a Database Documentation Tool: The Hidden Power of Model Comments](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/django-as-a-database-documentation-tool-the-hidden-power-of-model-comments/) by Ryan Cheley
-->
<p>Ryan Cheley works in healthcare. Due to the complexity of the terminology, it can be difficult to decipher what data in a database table field is used for.</p>
<p>There is a documentation gap. Code comments != database documentation. Wiki pages get stale. Undocumented expertise doesn‚Äôt scale.</p>
<p>Also, in his highly regulated field, regulatory auditors need field-level documentation.</p>
<p>Database comments were introduced in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/releases/4.2/#comments-on-columns-and-tables">Django 4.2</a>. They are not supported in SQLite.</p>
<p>Db comments can be at a field or table-level:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Field-level: db_comment</p></li>
<li><p>Table-level: db_table_comment</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-ryan-cheley-db-comment-example.jpg" />
db_comment example</p>
<p>Not everyone has access to the frontend.</p>
<p>help_text is only visible on the frontend/admin. It doesn‚Äôt help on the database-side.</p>
<p>It is recommended that help_text and db_comment both be used, but they tend to not be the same.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-ryan-cheley-different-audiences.jpg" />
Different audiences, different needs</p>
<p>How to get started with database comments at a field-level</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Audit your top 10 most confusing fields (cryptic names, complex business logic)</p></li>
<li><p>Document them (business context, calculation methodology, compliance notes)</p></li>
<li><p>Standardize them (make it part of your code reviews, add tests that fail if db_comment is not there)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How to get started with database comments at a table-level</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Audit your top 10 most confusing tables</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the table owner</p></li>
<li><p>Document, standardize, test</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This can make life easier for those who only have access to the database and our future selves.</p>

<h3>Keynote: Django Reimagined for The Age of AI<a class="headerlink" href="#keynote-django-reimagined-for-the-age-of-ai" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<!--
[Django Reimagined for The Age of AI](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/keynote-wednesday/) by Marlene Mhangami
-->
<p>Marlene Mhangami led the first PyCon Africa and is a former PSF Chair. She is an explorer and maker, and one of my favorite follows on social media.</p>
<p>Marlene pointed out that ChatGPT was the fastest growing app in history and the 5th most visited website in the world. AI is not just for CEOs are futurists. Real people are using it in their everyday lives. We should pay attention.</p>
<p>What does the future of Django look like in the age of AI?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-marlene-mhangami-key-points.jpg" /></p>
<p>Despite the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/misc/design-philosophies/#explicit-is-better-than-implicit">Django design philosophy</a> (based on <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python/PEP 20</a>) that Django should not do too much magic, LLMs feel like magic.</p>
<p>To better understand what an LLLM is, Marlene demonstrated an <a class="reference external" href="https://marlenezw.github.io/token-probability/">LLM token probability visualizer</a> that she had made (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/marlenezw/token-probability">code</a>).</p>
<p>Context matters.</p>
<p>Can we trust LLMs? Marlene gave the example of Grok telling people about ‚ÄúWhite Genocide.‚Äù</p>
<p>She said AI presents serous ethical issues, and we need to hold frontier labs accountable and expect transparency for what LLMs say to the public and environmental issues.</p>
<p>Just because something is flawed, it does not mean it isn‚Äôt useful.</p>
<p>As a Django dev, how can I control the context I send?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>RAG</p></li>
<li><p>MCP</p></li>
<li><p>AGENTS.md</p></li>
</ol>
<p>RAG involves feeding info from docs or a database into an LLM through the messages param in order control how the LLM responds.</p>
<p>MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how apps provide context to LLMs. A Django app can be an MCP host.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/djangocon-us-marlene-mhangami-mcp.jpg" /></p>
<p>Marlene created an example Welcome to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/marlenezw/django-mcp">Django Chat MCP app</a>.</p>
<p>While vibe coding in VSCode, you can use an <a class="reference external" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions#_use-an-agentsmd-file-experimental">AGENTS.md file</a> to specify best practices to follow.</p>
<p>AI generated code falls short in security, scalability, and maintainability.</p>
<p>How do we prevent leaving people behind?</p>
<p>Marlene told about the non-profit ZimboPy that she started with Ron Maravanyika to teach girls in Zimbabwe to code. Marlene was moved by the support received from the Django community, even though she was not a member. This is something unique about the Django community.</p>
<p>They utilized the popular and effective Django Girls tutorial that helps women ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù with programming.</p>
<p>Although the initiative started in affluent areas, they went to rural areas, too. The conditions were tough. There was no internet in community centers and electricity only some of the time.</p>
<p>She has been exploring the use of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/marlenezw/django-girls-offline/">a small language model bot offline</a> to walk learners through the Django Girls tutorial in places like this and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marlenemhangami_i-spent-a-bunch-of-time-recently-experimenting-activity-7373746042548355072-9DI6">has made progress</a>.</p>
<p>She says people still need to learn programming from scratch, but can be inspired by vibe coding. Be modular. Do a section at a time, read through the code yourself. Test the code.</p>
<p>Action items for making Django more friendly to work with LLMs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Central resources</p></li>
<li><p>Tell a Django AI story</p></li>
<li><p>Be open to AI as a community and framework</p></li>
<li><p>Make it clear and straightforward to integrate an LLM with a Django app to create a chat app (think FastAPI)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Chat is the primary interface and Marlene believes it will continue to be.</p>

<p>Based on an idea Paolo documented in his blog post <a class="reference external" href="https://www.paulox.net/2022/10/26/my-django-active-developers-sprints-proposal/">My Django active developers Sprints proposal</a>, Carlton Gibson and Paolo have begun to organize a twice a year Django development sprint called Django on the Med in Palafrugell, Spain and Pescara, Italy. The first one will taken place October 7-9, 2025, in Palafrugell Spain. If all goes well, they hope to organize them around the world. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://djangomed.eu/">Django on the Med</a> website for info about their serious goals and how to attend.</p>
<p>On the subject of convincing your employer to let you attend, Paolo suggested sharing ≈Åukasz Langa‚Äôs recent blog post <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/09/sprints-are-best-part-of-conference.html">Sprints are the best part of a conference</a>. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting for free what you wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy if you tried.‚Äù</p>

Typically, the DSF has an $18,000 surplus. This year will be a loss. The DSF has decided to make some bets. For example, the fellow role has become increasingly unsustainable. The DSF will need the help of the community to make these bets permanent. Consider supporting the DSF.</p>

<h3>What a Decade!<a class="headerlink" href="#what-a-decade" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<!--
[What a Decade!](https://2025.djangocon.us/talks/what-a-decade/) by Tim Allen
-->
<p>Tim Allen told the audience, you are my people, people trying to be a better version of themselves everyday and make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Tim is a Principal Engineer at Wharton Research Data Services who loves ice cream.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Wharton was a Coldfusion and Microsoft SQL Server Shop. In 2013, technical debt was mounting. Wharton needed to find something new.</p>
<p>Wharton created the Development Technology Assessment Process (DevTAP), a series of 200 questions to score that would be used to identify a new technology. The process was designed to be iterative so that decisions could be revisited and re-assessed.</p>
<p>Wharton chose Python/Django as the new framework, but the only community question had been: How active is the tool on Stack Overflow?</p>
<p>They got lucky that the community was morally and ethically aligned with them.</p>
<p>This community walks the walk when it comes to DEI.</p>
<p>Tim was blown away that Russell Keith-Magee opened up to the community about his <a class="reference external" href="https://pyvideo.org/djangocon-us-2015/i-am-a-doctor-tw-by-russell-keith-magee.html">personal battles with depression</a>. If someone as accomplished as Russell could be vulnerable, so can we. We all have a deep-rooted fear that we won‚Äôt be accepted.</p>
<p>Tim shared his personal journey with alcoholism.</p>
<p>Tim had brought Han Dynasty food to PyCon 2015 in Montreal as a bribe to host DjangoCon US in Philly (fun fact: the day before PyGotham 2018, I randomly saw Tim in mid-town Manhattan and joined his group for dinner at Han Dynasty).</p>
<p>Tim‚Äôs alcoholism was progressing. He had intended to go a full month without drinking, but never had.</p>
<p>Frank Wiles bought him his last drink ever.</p>
<p>Jacob Kaplan-Moss gave a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE">keynote</a> in which he quoted Lynn Root that we‚Äôd know when diversity efforts have been successful when we see a whole bunch of average women programmers. The talk has become a part of an amazing confluence of events that changed Tim‚Äôs life forever.</p>
<p>He had no idea it was his first day sober. Returning home, he found his family there to stage an intervention. He accepted the help that was being offered.</p>
<p>He had to be open that he was being intentional to no longer drink. Tim was assured that recovery is part of DjangoCon US diversity initiatives and welcome. Steps were taken to de-emphasize alcohol, and local recovery groups were added to the conference website.</p>
<p>Tim was going to focus on tech in his talk, but that changed on Friday when he found out his co-worker Lindsay Rees has passed away.</p>
<p>He does not believe he would be alive if not for the support he has gotten.</p>
<p>The community is willing to have difficult conversations and help. ‚ÄúYou matter. You are valued.‚Äù</p>
