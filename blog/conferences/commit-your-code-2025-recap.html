<h2>Intro<a class="headerlink" href="#intro" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>After having a lot of FOMO last year, I was able to spend some time this week at the Commit Your Code 2025 conference.</p>
<p>I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to meet a few “famous” techies who I knew would be in attendance and catch some talks from a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.commityourcode.com/agenda">packed agenda</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="thursday">
<h2>Thursday<a class="headerlink" href="#thursday" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The conference got off to a great start when I was greeted by conference founder Danny Thompson at the registration desk.</p>
<p>I have been following Danny on social media for years. He went from <a class="reference external" href="https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/from-frying-chicken-to-working-at-google-danny-thompson/">frying chicken at a gas station to working as a developer at Google</a>. I admire his authenticity and the support he gives to developers trying to get their own careers off the ground.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/justin-francesco-me.jpg" />
Justin E. Samuels, Francesco Ciulla, and me</p>
<p>Upon joining the coffee line, I serendipitously grabbed a photo with Justin E. Samuels, founder of the extremely popular <a class="reference external" href="https://www.renderatl.com/">RenderATL</a> conference, and prolific conference speaker Francesco Ciulla.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/danny-thompson-keynote.jpg" />

<p>Copies of Danny’s new book <a class="reference external" href="https://nostarch.com/developers-guide-to-AI">The Developer’s Guide to AI</a> (co-written with Jacob Orshalick and Jerry Mannel Reghunadh) quickly sold out and all the proceeds went to charity.</p>
<p>After the keynotes, Erik Weibust gave me the tip that Java talks by Josh Long and Dan Vega were not-to-be-missed.</p>

Hallway track. The place was buzzing.</p>

<h2>Friday<a class="headerlink" href="#friday" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/the-bean-guys.jpg" />
Delicious coffee from The Bean Guys. I had a caramel latte for the second day in a row. Nice way to start the day.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/aaron-francis.jpg" />
Aaron Francis teaching timeless strategies for success in his keynote. A lot of nuggets of wisdom in this.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/dan-vega.jpg" />
Dan Vega teaching us about Spring and MCP.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/rizell-scarlett.jpg" />
Rizell Scarlett demoed MCP-UI</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/me-and-rizell.jpg" />
I have been a fan of Rizell Scarlett for quite some time. We likely interviewed for the same position at GitHub. I remember seeing her on stage at GitHub Universe. Over the years, I have marveled at all that she has accomplished. It was so good to finally meet her in person. When I told her I want to experiment with MCP, she told me, “You’ve got this.” :)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/bas-steins.jpg" />
Bas Steins giving a plug for his tool Stelvio.</p>
<p>I knew of Bas Steins from his <a class="reference external" href="https://bas.codes/">This Week in Python blog posts</a>. Because there was not a Python track at this conference, I assumed the speaker was a different Bas. When I realized it was the same Bas, I hurried to the talk and met him afterward to show my appreciation!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/mark-thompson.jpg" />
Mark Thompson brought the energy and tips for how to navigate the age of AI. It was a full house. He was one of the most dynamic speakers I have ever seen!</p>
<p>I finished the day with a great conversation with Francesco Ciulla who shared with me some nuggets of wisdom from his career.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../_images/quincy-danny-leon.jpg" />
A lot of empathy and generosity in this room… Quincy Larson (freeCodeCamp), Danny Thompson (Dallas Software Developers Cohort Program), Leon Noel (100Devs) closing out the conference.</p>
<p>Thanks to the support of Yum! Brands International and conference attendees, $24k and counting will be donated to charity.</p>

<h2>In Closing<a class="headerlink" href="#in-closing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>I went away from the conference feeling inspired to try some new things. I also saw some incredible public speakers.</p>
<p>The replays are available on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/&#64;DallasSoftwareDevelopers">Dallas Software Developer YouTube</a>. Enjoy!</p>
